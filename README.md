# ammaru-kun-bot
LINE chatbot to perform simple commands (sending pictures from static directory and sending predetermined text messages) built with Flask and Line Chatbot SDK. The script is deployed to Heroku, then connected to LINE messaging API via its webhook service.

Feel free to use this as your learning material, as I provided detailed comments on the code. The text messages are in Indonesian, so translate it yourself to understand what is it about.

Deploy this to Heroku according to LINE's tutorial on its developer web.

The code took references from various tutorials and articles.
